## Audio Demo
We provide examples from the CineTTS dataset alongside speech generated by our proposed model, as well as corresponding audio outputs from the other models used in our experiments.

## Varying Persona
In this section, we demonstrate our model's capability to generate different speech styles given the same reference voice, and dialog history, but **<u>varying speaker characteristics</u>**. 

### Demo 1
**Reference Speech (used for speaker timbre extraction):**  
<audio controls src="wavs/diff_persona_1/ref_speech.wav"></audio>

**Dialog History:**  
[SPK0]: Anyway, I can see you're far more in need of responsible advice than I realised. Nobody does anything worth doing without a degree.<br>
[SPK1]: Nobody does anything worth doing with a degree. No woman, anyway.<br>
[SPK0]: So what I do isn't worth doing, or what Miss Stubbs does, or Mrs Wilson, or any of us here.<br>

**Next Utterance:**<br>
[SPK0]: Because none of us would be here without a degree, you do realise that, don't you? And yes, of course, studying is hard and boring.
